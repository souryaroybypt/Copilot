# README: Explaining Deprecated and Non-Readable Code in `App.jsx`

## Overview

This project contains a React component in `src/App.jsx` that demonstrates fetching and displaying user data from an API. However, the code uses several non-standard and obfuscated practices that may hinder readability and maintainability. This README explains these aspects for future maintainers.

---

### What the `OriginalCode` Component Does

- Fetches a list of users from the API endpoint `https://dummyjson.com/users` using `XMLHttpRequest`.
- Stores the user data in component state and displays it in a grid layout.
- Provides a search input to filter users by their first and last names.
- Allows sorting users alphabetically (A→Z or Z→A) by first name.
- Includes a counter button that increments a value on click.
- Lets users mark/unmark any user as a favorite, visually indicating the status.
- Shows loading and status messages during data fetch operations.
- Displays the raw API response in a collapsible details section for debugging or inspection.
- Uses inline CSS for all styling directly within the JSX elements.

---

## 1. Obfuscated Variable Names
- The code uses Greek letters (e.g., `α`, `β`, `γ`, `δ`, etc.) as variable names for state and functions. This is non-standard in JavaScript/React and makes the code hard to read and maintain.
- Example:
	- `const [α, setα] = $s(0);` // Counter
	- `const [β, setβ] = $s([]);` // Users array
	- `const [γ, setγ] = $s(false);` // Loading state
	- ...and so on for other state variables.

**Recommendation:** Use descriptive English names for variables and state, such as `count`, `users`, `loading`, etc.

---

## 2. Aliased React Imports
- The code imports `useState` and `useEffect` as `$s` and `$e` respectively:
	```js
	import { useState as $s, useEffect as $e } from "react";
	```
- This is unconventional and can confuse readers who expect standard React hooks.

**Recommendation:** Use the standard names for React hooks.

---

## 3. Deprecated XMLHttpRequest
- The code uses `XMLHttpRequest` to fetch data from the API:
	```js
	var _$ = new XMLHttpRequest();
	_$.open("GET", "https://dummyjson.com/users", true);
	...
	_$.send();
	```
- `XMLHttpRequest` is considered deprecated for most modern web development. The `fetch` API or libraries like `axios` are preferred for HTTP requests in React.

**Recommendation:** Replace `XMLHttpRequest` with the `fetch` API for better readability and modern standards.

---

## 4. Unclear Function and Variable Purposes
- Functions and variables are named with obfuscated or non-descriptive names (e.g., `_0x1`, `_0xF`, `_f`).
- This makes it difficult to understand the code's intent without reading through the entire implementation.

**Recommendation:** Use clear, descriptive names for all functions and variables.

---

## 5. General Readability Issues
- The combination of non-standard variable names, aliased imports, and deprecated APIs makes the code hard to follow for new contributors.
- While the UI logic is standard, the obfuscation adds unnecessary complexity.

---

## 6. Excessive Inline CSS
- The component uses a large amount of inline CSS directly in JSX elements (e.g., `style={{ ... }}` on many tags).
- This practice makes the code visually cluttered and harder to scan, as style definitions are mixed with logic and markup.
- It also makes it difficult to reuse styles, maintain consistency, and update the UI design efficiently.

**Recommendation:** Move styles to external CSS files or use CSS-in-JS solutions (like styled-components or emotion) for better separation of concerns and improved readability.

---

## 7. Lack of Error Handling
- The code does not handle errors that may occur during the API request (e.g., network failures, invalid responses, or server errors).
- If the request fails, the user interface does not display any error message or feedback, which can confuse users and make debugging difficult.

**Recommendation:** Add error handling logic to display user-friendly error messages and update the UI state appropriately when a request fails.

| Symbol | Purpose                | Recommended Name |
|--------|------------------------|------------------|
| α      | Counter                | count            |
| β      | Users array            | users            |
| γ      | Loading state          | loading          |
| δ      | Error message          | error            |
| ε      | Search input           | search           |
| ζ      | Sort order (A-Z/Z-A)   | sortAZ           |
| η      | Favorites array        | favorites        |
| θ      | Raw API response       | apiResponse      |
| ι      | Status string          | status           |
| κ      | Fetch duration (ms)    | fetchTime        |

## Final Notes
- Refactoring the code to use standard naming conventions and modern APIs will greatly improve maintainability and onboarding for new developers.
- If you have questions about the code, refer to this README or consider refactoring for clarity.
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
